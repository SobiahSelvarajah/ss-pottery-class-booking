                    <p>
                        Kiln & Clay was created to make pottery more accessible. We bring together independent studios, skilled makers, and curious beginners in one thoughtful space.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whether you're touching clay for the first time or returning to a long-loved craft, we believe the process matters as much as the finished piece.
